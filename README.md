# WebEye

The other end of a webhook

A simple Sinatra app (runs nicely on Heroku) that catches a webhook from
EveryPolitician (which has in its POST payload the latest `countries.json`
file).

### More information

See [the EveryPolitician project](http://everypolitician.org)

The webhooks are generated by EveryPolitician's [app-manager](https://github.com/everypolitician/app-manager).


### Dev/debug hint

To simulate the webhook's POST call, make a local copy of 
[countries.json](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/everypolitician/everypolitician-data/master/countries.json).
Then run with `foreman start` and hit the WebEye with:

`curl -X POST -d @countries.json http://localhost:5000/ --header "Content-Type:application/json"`
