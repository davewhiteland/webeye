# WebEye

The other end of a webhook

A simple Sinatra app (runs nicely on Heroku) that catches a webhook from
EveryPolicitian (which has in its POST payload the latest `countries.json`
file).

### More information

See [the EveryPolitician project](http://everypolitician.org)

The webhooks are generated by EveryPolitician's [app-manager](https://github.com/everypolitician/app-manager).
